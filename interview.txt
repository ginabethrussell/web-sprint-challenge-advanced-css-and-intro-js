1. How would you describe accessibility ...?
Accessibility is the idea that the things we create should be equally available to everyone. 
For example, the vision impaired and blind should still be able to access and use our sites. 

2. Three different things that help make websites more accessible are
    a. proper color contrast to make text readable for the visually impaired
    b. alt text indicating the content of all images for the blind or others who use screen readers
    view our page
    c. avoid hard coding font-sizes in pixels which prevent users from adjusting the fonts
    with their browser settings
    Other techniques include making sure users can tab through our text with a keyboard,
    and using semantic html to make content understandable

3. A variable is a way we can reference data to store and reuse in our programs. This data 
is stored in the computer's memory and is accessible to us by using the identifier name.
Depending on the data type, the variable name may reference the data directly, like with a number, 
or as with arrays and object may reference the location in memory where the data begins.

4. The purpose of functions in code is so we can store references to blocks of code we may
want to use repeatedly without having to type the code each time we use it. This follows the
programming philosophy DRY, don't repeat yourself. Functions are also a great way to group tasks/commands 
that do something specific for us.
